//Question:c) What is the delay of your 32-bit prefix adder from part (a)? Assume that each two-input gate delay is 100 ps. 

t_(prefix_adder)= t_pg + log2N(t_prefixblock) + t_xor (these all are gate delays)

given that two-input gate delay is 100 ps :

N=32 so therefore log2N= log_base2_32 
therefore : 5

Each stage requires a two-input gate delay of 100 ps.
Total delay = 
5×100=500 ps
The sum computation requires XOR gates at the end, contributing another 1 gate delay (100 ps).


Total delay=500ps+200ps=700ps.
